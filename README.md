This is a website for a user profile.

The first page src/index.html is the user's profile page and is used to view all of the user's details in an organised manner. 
Next, when the user clicks on edit profile, it redirects to a page with a form to edit the user details.
The editing form works using the local storage of the browser and using JSON to store the profile data. So, it can currently store only 1 user's data while being able to edit it.

This is an incomplete project and the edits cannot be viewed on the main profile page and also the styling of the form needs improvement. These are under construction as of 15-06-2024.
